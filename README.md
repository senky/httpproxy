<dl>
  <dt>What is the problem?</dt>
  <dd>You switched your board to secure HTTPS protocol, but your users post images from HTTP sources. That poses a threat to them, because an attacker can replace the image with his own content or use users' data against them.</dd>

  <dt>How to fix this?</dt>
  <dd>You as a domain owner should ensure that all content comes from secure origins. But this is difficult with forums, where users create the content. Luckily, there is a technique called HTTP proxy which solves the issue.</dd>

  <dt>Final solution for forums</dt>
  <dd>This extension utilizes such a HTTP proxy, replacing insecure images with a special link leading to your own server which downloads and secures the image instead of user's browser. Whatever your users post, you make them safe all the time.</dd>

  <dt>Any style, any language</dt>
  <dd>The extension works under the hood - you and your users won't notice anything, regardless of board style and language. Neat, isn't it?</dd>

  <dt>Lazyloading?</dt>
  <dd>Using LazyLoad for post images extension? Don't worry, you are covered. Another extension that isn't supported? Just contact author.</dd>
